     node_modules/, www/, resources/, icons/, package files
   - .gitignore: added android/, ios/, www/, ai-config.js


WHAT YOU NEED TO DO (Manual Steps)
===============================================

STEP 1: INSTALL ANDROID STUDIO (for Google Play)
-------------------------------------------------
Download: https://developer.android.com/studio
- Free to install and use
- Requires ~2-4 GB disk space

STEP 2: BUILD ANDROID APP
-------------------------------------------------
Run these commands in your project folder:

    npx cap sync android
    npx cap open android

This opens Android Studio. Then:
1. Wait for Gradle sync to finish (first time takes a few minutes)
2. Go to Build > Generate Signed Bundle / APK
3. Select "Android App Bundle"
4. Create a new keystore (signing key):
   - Choose a file location and password
   - Fill in the certificate info
   - SAVE THIS KEYSTORE FILE — you need it for every future update
5. Build the .aab file
6. The .aab file will be in: android/app/release/

STEP 3: UPLOAD TO GOOGLE PLAY
-------------------------------------------------
1. Go to https://play.google.com/console
2. Pay the $25 one-time developer fee
3. Create a new app:
   - App name: Secret Word Imposter
   - Default language: English
   - App type: Game
   - Category: Word / Party
4. Fill in the store listing:
   - Short description (80 chars max)
   - Full description (4000 chars max)
   - Screenshots (at least 2, phone size)
   - Feature graphic (1024x500)
   - App icon (512x512 — use resources/icon.png)
5. Complete the content rating questionnaire
6. Add a privacy policy URL
7. Go to Production > Create new release
8. Upload the .aab file
9. Submit for review (usually takes 1-7 days)

STEP 4: BUILD iOS APP (requires Mac with Xcode)
-------------------------------------------------
Run these commands in your project folder:

    npx cap sync ios
    npx cap open ios

This opens Xcode. Then:
1. Select the "App" target in the left sidebar
2. Under "Signing & Capabilities":
   - Select your Apple Developer team
   - Bundle identifier should be: com.secretword.imposter
3. Select a connected device or "Any iOS Device"
4. Go to Product > Archive
5. Once archived, click "Distribute App"
6. Choose "App Store Connect"
7. Follow the upload wizard

STEP 5: UPLOAD TO APP STORE
-------------------------------------------------
1. Go to https://appstoreconnect.apple.com
2. Requires Apple Developer Program ($99/year)
   Sign up at: https://developer.apple.com/programs/
3. Create a new app in App Store Connect:
   - Name: Secret Word Imposter
   - Bundle ID: com.secretword.imposter
   - SKU: secretword-imposter
4. Fill in the store listing:
   - Description, keywords, support URL
   - Screenshots (iPhone 6.7", 6.5", 5.5" sizes)
   - App icon (1024x1024 — use resources/icon.png)
5. Add a privacy policy URL (required)
6. Submit for review (usually takes 1-3 days)


PRIVACY POLICY
===============================================
Both stores require a privacy policy URL. You can create a simple one:

1. Create a file called privacy.html in your project
2. Deploy it with Firebase (it'll be at imposter-sandeshg.web.app/privacy.html)
3. Content should cover:
   - What data you collect (Firebase anonymous auth, display names)
   - How data is used (gameplay only)
   - Third-party services (Firebase, Google Gemini API)
   - Contact information


UPDATING THE APP AFTER PUBLISHING
===============================================
Since the app loads from your live Firebase URL, updating is simple:

    firebase deploy --only hosting

Users automatically get the latest version without needing to update
the app from the store.

You only need to rebuild and resubmit to the stores if you:
- Change the app icon or splash screen
- Add new native plugins (e.g., push notifications)
- Change the Capacitor config
